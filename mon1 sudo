1.  Set constants:
    STARTRAM = 0x800
    STARTSTACK = 0x0FF0
    DISPLAY = 0x0FF1
    DISPLAY2 = 0x0FF3
    DISPLAY3 = 0x0FF4
    DISPLAY4 = 0x0FF5
    DISPLAY5 = 0x0FF6
    DISPLAY6 = 0x0FF7
    ADDRESS = 0x0FF7
    MODE = 0x0FF9
    KEYFLAG = 0x0FFA
    INV_SCORE = 0x0FFA
    INV_GUN = 0x0FFB
    PORTKEYB = 0x00
    PORTDIGIT = 0x01
    PORTSPKR = 0x01
    PORTSEGS = 0x02
    PORTSLOW = 0x03
    PORTFAST = 0x04
    SLOWSEQ = 0x0800
    FASTSEQ = 0x0B00
    ENDOFSEQ = 0xFF
    REPEATTEXT = 0x1E
    ENDOFTEXT = 0x1F
    REPEATTUNE = 0x1E
    ENDOFTUNE = 0x1F
    NIMMATCHES = 0x0FFA

2.  Initialize:
    Start program at STARTRAM
    Initialize the stack pointer to STARTSTACK
    Clear all display registers

3.  Main Operations:
    If the button pressed (PORTKEYB) corresponds to the start of a game:
        Initialize game variables (e.g., SCORE, GUN)
        Clear the display
        Enter game loop:
            Display game state
            Update game state based on player input and game logic
            Play sounds and music as required
            Repeat until game over condition is met

4.  Game specifics:
    For each game (e.g., Invaders, NIM, Lunar Lander):
        Set up game-specific variables and display
        Handle player inputs specifically for that game
        Update game state and display
        Check for end conditions and handle transitions

5.  Subroutines:
    Handle display updates, input reading, sound playing, and other recurring tasks with specific subroutines:
        ReadInput: Poll the keyboard or other input device and return the input
        UpdateDisplay: Take input and update the display accordingly
        PlaySound: Trigger sound output based on game events
        HandleGameLogic: Specific to each game, to process game rules and state updates

6.  Interrupt Handling:
    Set up interrupt service routines for handling asynchronous events or actions

7.  Utility Functions:
    Convert game values to display formats
    Manage memory and stack for routine calls and returns
