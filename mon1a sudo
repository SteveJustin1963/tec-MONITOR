// Define constants and memory addresses
// (For display, key input, mode selection, game states, etc.)

Initialize hardware and system state:
  Set initial memory pointers
  Set display and keyboard I/O ports
  Load initial data into memory addresses

// Main jump points for different functionalities
Jump to the starting monitor routine:
  Initialize system and possibly run diagnostics
  Set default values for registers and system states
  Clear memory or registers as needed

Define game and utility subroutines:
  Invaders Game:
    Initialize game state (score, gun position, etc.)
    Clear the display
    Main game loop:
      If invaders are present:
        Move invaders closer or handle game logic (e.g., shooting)
      Else:
        Populate new invaders
      Check for user input (shoot, move gun, etc.)
      Update display and game state accordingly
      If game over condition met:
        Handle end-game (reset, show score, etc.)

  NIM Game:
    Set up initial matches and game state
    Main game loop:
      Display current state (matches left)
      Get player's move
      Adjust match count based on player's move
      Switch turns between player and computer
      If end condition is met (no matches left):
        Determine winner and display result
      Refresh display and wait for next move

  Lunar Lander Game:
    Initialize lander state (altitude, fuel, velocity)
    Main simulation loop:
      Adjust lander's altitude and velocity based on user input and gravity
      Check fuel levels and reduce as necessary when thrusters used
      Update display with current altitude, velocity, and fuel
      If landing or crash conditions are met:
        Play appropriate tune (win/loss)
        Reset game or provide options to restart

  Tune Playing:
    Load tune sequence from memory
    Play each note by sending frequencies to sound hardware
    Handle repeats and pauses as dictated by tune data
    Continue until tune ends or is interrupted

// Display and sound utilities
Display Management:
  Convert numbers or game states into display format (e.g., segment code for LEDs)
  Update display continuously based on game or system state
  Include effects like blinking or beeping for feedback

Input Handling:
  Poll keyboard or input device regularly
  Update game state or system settings based on input
  Provide immediate feedback or action based on key presses

Utility Functions:
  Convert numerical data to display encoding (e.g., BCD to 7-segment)
  Perform arithmetic operations needed for game logic (add, subtract, compare)
  Implement delay loops for timing and synchronization between operations
