// Initial Setup
Set Program Counter to STARTMON
Initialize memory vectors

// Keyboard Interrupt Routine at 0066h
On Keyboard NMI:
  Save register state
  Read key from key port, save to KEYDATA
  Restore register state
  Return from interrupt

// Hexadecimal to Seven Segment Data Mapping
Define SEVSEGDATA with values corresponding to each hex digit

// Main Monitor Entry Point
STARTMON:
  Save current stack pointer
  Set stack pointer to RAMSTART
  Save system state
  Initialize system variables
  Loop:
    Check for key press
    Execute corresponding action based on key code

// Keyboard Function Implementation
// Shift+Insert - Range fill 0900 - 4000
// Shift+Delete - Clear range 0900 - 03FF
// Shift+Address - Jump to location in 08D2, 08D3
If Shift+Insert pressed:
  Fill memory from 0900 to 4000 with data
If Shift+Delete pressed:
  Clear memory from 0900 to 03FF
If Shift+Address pressed:
  Jump to memory address stored at 08D2, 08D3

// Vector Calls - Redirect based on interrupt or user action
For each vector in USER_VECTORS:
  Jump to address stored in vector

// NMI Keyboard Handling
On NMI from Keyboard:
  Store key press in KEYDATA
  Resume operations

// Display Handling
For each display action:
  Convert current address or data to display code using SEVSEGDATA
  Update display

// Utility Functions
Play Tone or Tune based on TUNEADDR data
Handle user input for editing memory addresses or data
Update display and system status based on mode

// Additional System Calls and Routine Mappings
Map additional functionality such as memory editing, sound playback, etc., based on system mode and user input
