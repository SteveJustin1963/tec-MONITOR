# JMON User Manual

## Quick Start Guide
1. Power on your system
2. Default display shows address and data sections
3. Initial editing location: 0800

 
## How to Enter Data
1. Simply type hex digits (0-F)
2. Data appears in right display
3. Location auto-increments after two digits
4. Use + or - to move between locations manually

## Basic Data Entry Mode
- Default mode when JMON starts
- Shows an address in left display and data in right display
- Current editing location is displayed on left
- Data at that location is displayed on right

## Step-by-Step Data Entry Process
1. **View Current Location**
   - Left display shows current memory address
   - Right display shows current byte value at that address
   - Dots indicate which mode you're in:
     - No dots = Data entry mode
     - Four dots = Address entry mode

2. **Enter First Nibble (0-F)**
   - Press any hex key (0-9 or A-F)
   - Value appears in left half of right display
   - Old value remains in right half
   - Monitor Control Byte tracks this as one nibble entered

3. **Enter Second Nibble (0-F)**
   - Press second hex key (0-9 or A-F)
   - Value appears in right half of display
   - Complete byte is now entered
   - Data is written to memory at current location

4. **Auto-Increment**
   - After second nibble entry:
     - Location automatically advances to next address
     - New address shows in left display
     - Ready for next byte entry
   - Can be disabled by setting memory location 0827

## Manual Navigation
- Use `+` key to:
   - Move to next memory location
   - Increment current address by 1

- Use `-` key to:
   - Move to previous memory location
   - Decrement current address by 1

## Tips and Tricks
1. **Entering Multiple Bytes**
   - Let auto-increment handle address advancement
   - Just keep entering hex pairs
   - Monitor automatically moves to next location

2. **Correcting Mistakes**
   - Use + or - to return to incorrect location
   - Enter new hex values to overwrite
   - Both nibbles must be re-entered

3. **Checking Work**
   - Use + and - to review entered data
   - Data shows in right display as you move
   - No data is changed unless you enter new values

4. **Visual Feedback**
   - Monitor Control Byte (082B) tracks:
     - Number of nibbles entered
     - Current mode
     - Auto-increment status

## Common Errors to Avoid
1. **Partial Entry**
   - Always complete both nibbles
   - Half-entered bytes may not be stored correctly

2. **Wrong Mode**
   - Ensure no dots are showing for data entry
   - If dots appear, you're in address mode
   - Press AD to return to data mode

3. **Lost Position**
   - Note starting address before long sequences
   - Use address mode to return to known location

4. **Auto-Increment Issues**
   - If location isn't advancing automatically:
     - Check memory location 0827
     - Verify you're entering complete bytes
     - Ensure you're in data mode

## Special Considerations
- Each memory location holds one byte (00-FF)
- First nibble entered goes to high order position
- Second nibble goes to low order position
- Invalid hex keys are ignored
- Current location is preserved during mode changes







# How to Change Address
1. Press AD key
2. Notice four dots appear in display
3. Enter new address using hex digits
4. System returns to data mode automatically

The JMON address change feature provides direct memory access through a simple four-step process. When you press the AD key, JMON switches from data mode to address mode, visually indicated by four dots appearing in the address display section. This mode change is tracked in the Monitor Control Byte (082B) with bit 4 set to indicate address mode. Once in address mode, you must enter exactly four hex digits to specify the target address - for example, to go to address 08A4, you would enter the digits sequentially, with the display updating as you type: first '0' (showing 0xxx), then '8' (showing 08xx), then 'A' (showing 08Ax), and finally '4' (showing 08A4). Each digit entered represents a nibble (4 bits) of the 16-bit address, with the first two digits forming the high byte and the last two forming the low byte. After all four digits are entered, JMON automatically switches back to data mode, clears the four dots, displays your new address on the left, and shows the data at that memory location on the right. There's no way to backspace or partially enter an address - you must complete all four digits or start over, and invalid key presses are simply ignored.




# How to Save Programs to Tape
1. Enter SHIFT+0 (or AD+0)
2. Press + until "SAVE-H" appears
   - H = High speed (600 baud)
   - L = Low speed (300 baud)
3. Press GO
4. Enter file parameters:
   - File number (e.g., "00-F")
   - Start address ("-S")
   - End address ("-E")
   - Optional auto-GO address ("-G")
5. Start tape recording
6. Press GO to begin save
7. Wait for "-END-S" display
8. Remember: Always save important programs multiple times and verify loads before relying on tape storage.

JMON's tape save functionality provides a reliable method for storing programs using standard cassette tapes. The process begins by accessing the tape menu through either SHIFT+0 or the alternate method of pressing AD followed by 0. Once in the menu system, use the + key to navigate until you see "SAVE-H" (or cycle through to "SAVE-L" for low speed). The high-speed option runs at 600 baud while low speed operates at 300 baud - low speed is more reliable but takes longer. After pressing GO, JMON enters its parameter entry mode where you specify the save details in sequence. First, enter a two-digit file number followed by F (like "00-F") which uniquely identifies your program. Next, at the "-S" prompt, enter the starting memory address of your program. When "-E" appears, enter the end address - JMON uses these addresses to know exactly what memory range to save. At the "-G" prompt, you can optionally specify an auto-execute address (or leave as FFFF for no auto-execute) - this address, if set, will automatically run your program when reloaded. With parameters set, start your tape recorder in record mode, press GO, and JMON begins the save process. The save operation starts with a leader tone, followed by the file information block, then your program data in 256-byte blocks with checksums. The LED display shows the number of complete blocks remaining. When complete, JMON displays "-END-S" and returns to the menu. Due to the potential for tape degradation or recording issues, it's critical to save important programs multiple times and always verify they load correctly before relying on the tape storage.


# How to Test Tape Saves
1. Enter SHIFT+0 (or AD+0)
2. Select test option:
   - "TEST-BL" = Block test
   - "TEST-CS" = Checksum test
3. Enter file number
4. Start tape
5. Watch for results:
   - "PASS CS" = Good checksum
   - "PASS Tb" = Good block test
   - "FAIL CS" = Bad checksum
   - "FAIL Tb" = Bad block test

JMON's tape testing capabilities provide two distinct methods for verifying your saved programs: block testing and checksum verification. Access these functions through the menu system (SHIFT+0 or AD+0) and navigate to either "TEST-BL" or "TEST-CS". The block test (TEST-BL) performs a byte-by-byte comparison between the tape data and memory contents, making it useful for verifying exact copies, while the checksum test (TEST-CS) calculates and compares checksums without loading data, providing a faster verification option. After selecting your test method, enter the file number you wish to verify (or FFFF to test the next file found on tape). When you start the tape playing, JMON automatically detects the speed (works with both 300 and 600 baud recordings) and begins the verification process. During testing, the LED display shows progress by indicating the number of complete 256-byte blocks remaining. Test results are clearly displayed: "PASS CS" or "PASS Tb" indicates successful verification, while "FAIL CS" or "FAIL Tb" signals problems with the recording. A failed test might indicate tape head alignment issues, incorrect volume levels, tape degradation, or recording problems. Block test failures show exactly where the mismatch occurred, helping identify specific problem areas. A checksum failure indicates data corruption but doesn't specify the location. If a test fails, try adjusting the playback volume, cleaning the tape heads, or re-recording the program using the lower speed (300 baud) option for increased reliability.


# How to Load Programs
1. Enter SHIFT+0 (or AD+0)
2. Press + until "LOAD-T" appears
3. Press GO
4. Enter parameters:
   - File number (or FFFF for next file)
   - Start address (optional override)
5. Start tape playback
6. Press GO
7. Watch for completion message:
   - "PASS Ld" = Success
   - "FAIL Ld" = Error

JMON's program loading functionality provides a flexible system for retrieving your saved programs from tape storage. Begin by entering the tape menu (using either SHIFT+0 or the alternate AD+0 method) and use the + key to navigate until "LOAD-T" appears on the display. After pressing GO, JMON enters its parameter entry mode. Here, you have two key decisions to make: First, enter either a specific file number to load a particular program, or enter FFFF to load the next file found on the tape - this FFFF option is particularly useful when loading a sequence of programs or when you're unsure of file numbers. Second, you can specify a load address that overrides the original save address - this allows you to relocate programs in memory, though be cautious with relocating address-dependent code. Once parameters are set and your tape is positioned, start playback and press GO. JMON automatically detects the tape speed (works with both 300 and 600 baud recordings) and begins the load process. During loading, the LED display shows progress by indicating the number of complete 256-byte blocks remaining. The system performs continuous checksum verification during loading to ensure data integrity. Upon completion, JMON displays either "PASS Ld" indicating a successful load with verified data, or "FAIL Ld" indicating a problem occurred during loading. If the loaded program has an auto-execute address specified (set during save with the "-G" parameter), and the load was successful, the program will automatically begin execution at that address. If a load fails, check your tape volume level, clean the tape heads, and consider using the slower 300 baud recording speed for better reliability.

A few critical points to remember:
- Always verify your loads immediately after saving important programs
- Keep the tape head clean and properly aligned
- Note if your program has address dependencies before using the relocation feature
- Consider the start address carefully - ensure you're not overwriting important memory areas
- Watch for proper block count during loading to catch early termination



# How to Single Step Through Code
1. Position to start address
2. Enter stepping mode
3. Display shows register contents:
   - Press + to view next register
   - Press - to view previous register
4. Available registers:
   - PC = Program Counter
   - AF = Accumulator/Flags
   - BC, DE, HL = Register pairs
   - IX, IY = Index registers
   - SP = Stack Pointer
5. Use GO to execute next instruction

JMON's single-step debugging capability is a powerful tool for program analysis and troubleshooting. This mode allows you to execute code one instruction at a time while monitoring the Z80 processor's internal state through all register values. To begin single stepping, first position to your program's start address using either the AD key and entering the address directly, or using +/- to navigate to it. Once positioned, enter stepping mode (through SHIFT+2). The display immediately switches to show register contents, starting with the Program Counter (PC) which shows the address of the next instruction to be executed. The display format shows both the register name and its current value, with the LED display divided into address and data sections.

Navigation through registers is straightforward: press + to cycle forward through the register set, or - to cycle backward. The complete register set available for inspection includes:
- PC (Program Counter): Shows next instruction address
- AF (Accumulator/Flags): A holds computation results, F shows status flags
- BC, DE, HL: General purpose register pairs, often used for data and addressing
- IX, IY: Index registers for advanced addressing modes
- SP (Stack Pointer): Points to current stack position

The real power comes when you press GO - this executes exactly one instruction at your current PC location, then automatically updates all register displays to show the results of that instruction. This allows you to:
- Watch data movement between registers
- Monitor flag changes after operations
- Track program flow through jumps and calls
- Verify memory modifications
- Debug complex operations step by step

If your code enters an endless loop or you need to exit stepping mode, a hard reset (holding any key during reset) will return you to normal monitor operation.

Some key technical aspects to remember:
- The system preserves register values during register display navigation
- Interrupts are managed during stepping to prevent interference
- Stack operations can be monitored through SP register changes
- The display updates automatically after each instruction
- Memory changes can be verified by stepping through to that address




# How to Use Auto-Increment
1. Feature is active by default
2. After entering two digits:
   - Location automatically advances
   - Ready for next data entry
3. To disable:
   - See memory location 0827
   - Set to non-zero value

JMON's auto-increment feature streamlines the process of entering consecutive bytes of data into memory. When active (the default state), the system automatically advances to the next memory location after you enter a complete byte (two hex digits). This feature is particularly valuable when entering program code or data sequences, as it eliminates the need to manually advance the address using the + key after each byte entry.

The process works like this: Enter your first hex digit (0-F) for the high nibble of the byte - it appears in the left half of the data display. Enter your second hex digit for the low nibble - it appears in the right half, completing the byte. At this point, auto-increment takes over: the system automatically advances to the next memory location, the address display increments by one, and the data display shows the contents of this new location, ready for your next byte entry.

The auto-increment function is controlled by memory location 0827, which serves as a flag:
- Value 0: Auto-increment enabled (default)
- Any non-zero value: Auto-increment disabled

To disable auto-increment:
1. Enter address mode (AD)
2. Enter address 0827
3. Enter any non-zero value
4. System will now stay at current location after byte entry

To re-enable:
1. Enter address mode (AD)
2. Enter address 0827
3. Enter 00
4. System will resume auto-incrementing

This feature interacts with the Monitor Control Byte (082B) which tracks the number of nibbles entered and ensures proper timing of the increment operation. The system maintains data integrity by only incrementing after a complete byte is entered, never during partial entry.





# How to Perform Reset
Soft Reset:
1. Normal reset operation
2. Preserves user patches
3. Maintains current settings

Hard Reset:
1. Hold any key while resetting
2. Clears all user patches
3. Resets all variables to default

JMON provides two types of reset operations, each serving different needs for system initialization and recovery. Let me explain both in detail:

Soft Reset:
This is your standard reset operation that provides a "gentle" system restart. When you initiate a soft reset (typically through the reset button without holding any keys), JMON:
- Preserves any user-installed patches in memory
- Maintains your custom settings and variables
- Retains the values in the Monitor Control Byte
- Keeps the current display buffer configuration
- Preserves the auto-increment setting
- Maintains any installed interrupt handlers
The soft reset essentially gives you a clean start while keeping your customizations intact. Think of it as a "refresh" rather than a complete restart.

Hard Reset:
This is your "nuclear option" for when you need to completely reinitialize the system. To perform a hard reset:
1. Hold down ANY key on the keyboard
2. Press and release the reset button
3. Continue holding the key until initialization completes

The hard reset performs these operations:
- Clears ALL user patches (except the reset patch)
- Resets ALL monitor variables to their default values
- Reinitializes the display buffer to 0800
- Resets the Monitor Control Byte to initial state
- Clears the key press flags
- Resets the auto-increment feature to enabled
- Reestablishes default interrupt handlers
- Sets the default initial editing location

This is particularly useful when:
- A user patch enters an endless loop
- The system becomes unresponsive
- You need to ensure a completely clean system state
- You're experiencing unexplained behavior
- You want to return to factory default settings

Important Memory Locations Affected:
- 082B: Monitor Control Byte - reset to 00
- 082C/D: Display Buffer Address - reset to 0800
- 0820: Key Buffer - cleared
- 0825: Key Press Flag - cleared
- 0827: Auto-increment Flag - reset to 00



# Error Recovery
When you see:
1. "Err-In":
   - Check input parameters
   - Verify address range
2. "FAIL" messages:
   - Check tape speed setting
   - Clean tape head
   - Adjust volume level
   - Try alternative load address
  
JMON's error recovery system provides specific error messages to help diagnose and resolve issues during operation. Let's break down each error type and its recovery procedures:

"Err-In" (Error Input):
This error typically appears during parameter entry or address operations and indicates an invalid input condition. Recovery steps:
1. Input Parameter Check:
   - Verify start address is lower than end address
   - Ensure addresses are within valid memory range
   - Check that file numbers are properly formatted
   - Confirm all required parameters are entered
2. Address Range Verification:
   - Check for conflicts with system memory areas
   - Verify program fits in target memory space
   - Ensure addresses are properly aligned for operation
3. Common Causes:
   - End address lower than start address
   - Invalid memory location specified
   - Parameter format errors
   - System area conflicts

"FAIL" Messages (Tape Operations):
These appear during tape operations and can indicate various issues:

1. "FAIL CS" (Checksum Failure):
   - Indicates data corruption during transfer
   Recovery steps:
   - Clean tape heads with alcohol
   - Adjust playback volume (try different levels)
   - Try slower speed (300 baud) setting
   - Verify tape is not wrinkled or damaged

2. "FAIL Tb" (Test Block Failure):
   - Indicates mismatch between tape and memory
   Recovery steps:
   - Check memory contents are correct
   - Verify correct file is being tested
   - Try reloading at different address
   - Consider re-recording the program

3. "FAIL Ld" (Load Failure):
   - Indicates problems during program loading
   Recovery steps:
   - Adjust tape player's position
   - Clean tape heads and mechanism
   - Try multiple volume levels
   - Consider alternate load address
   - Check tape quality and condition

General Recovery Procedures:
1. Tape Issues:
   - Regular head cleaning
   - Proper volume adjustment (usually 75% of maximum)
   - Correct tape player positioning
   - Quality tape media usage

2. System Issues:
   - Perform soft reset to clear temporary conditions
   - Use hard reset for complete system recovery
   - Check power supply stability
   - Verify system connections

3. Prevention:
